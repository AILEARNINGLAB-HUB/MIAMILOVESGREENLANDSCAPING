   - Applies professional-grade sharpening
   - Enhances colors and contrast
   - Reduces noise while preserving details
   - Increases the bitrate for better quality

## Option 2: Python-based Enhancement

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Steps
1. **Run the Python Enhancement Script**
   - Double-click on the `enhance_video.bat` file
   - This will install the required Python packages and run the enhancement script
   - The process may take several minutes

2. **What This Does**

   - Applies color space transformations for better processing
   - Enhances edges and details
   - Improves color saturation

## Option 3: Browser-side Enhancement (Already Active)

The website already includes multiple browser-side enhancements:

1. **CSS Enhancements**
   - Brightness, contrast, and saturation adjustments
   - Hardware acceleration for smoother playback
   - Image rendering optimizations for different browsers

2. **JavaScript Processing**
   - Real-time video processing using canvas
   - Frame-by-frame enhancement
   - Dynamic sharpening of edges
   - Color correction

## Combining Methods for Best Results

For the highest possible quality:

1. First use Option 1 (FFmpeg) or Option 2 (Python) to enhance the source video
2. The browser-side enhancements (Option 3) will automatically apply to the enhanced video

## Troubleshooting

- **FFmpeg Issues**: Make sure FFmpeg is properly installed and in your PATH
- **Python Issues**: If you encounter errors about missing packages, run:
  ```
  pip install opencv-python numpy tqdm
  ```
- **Browser Performance**: If the video playback is slow or jerky, try:
  - Using a more powerful computer
  - Disabling some of the CSS filters in the HTML file
  - Commenting out the JavaScript enhancer in the HTML file
